#### Briefly About Myself:
Having started my career, while i was at university, as a computer repair engineer in a local service center with minimum skills, i became experienced in electronics. My desire to learn and teach was realized by working as a teacher at school.

Three years ago  I became the head of the resource center for information technologies in education in my homegrown city. I've mastered different technologies, learned to work with optical networks, accompanied the work of schools' websites.

Work as the head of the CIT required additional knowledge in Frontend Development. I'm interested in Web Development, because it provides to me endless possibilities for professional growth, requires constant training and give to me possibility to solve complex problems.

I believe, that my ability to self-education, gain new skills and addiction to solve new problems will lead me to a proficient Frontend Developer

#### Code example:
**Problem**:If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
**Solution**:
```
function solution(number){
  if (number < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < number; i++) {
    if ((i % 3 === 0) || (i % 5 === 0)) {
      sum += i;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
